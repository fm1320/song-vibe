3. (For Training a new index) The file  `data.csv` is an example of what the training data of song descriptions looks like. This training data has been synthetically generated by prompting an LLM.
   By running `train.py` the song descriptions are encoded by a transformer network and a vector index file `index.bin` using FAISS is created. Currenlty a flat index is used.

> **Note:** Make sure you have a paid OpenAI API key for faster completions and to avoid hitting rate limits.

streamlit run app.py
```
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to access the app.
